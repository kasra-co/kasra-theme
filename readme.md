# Kasra Theme

**Project scope**

- Specifications: style guide / usage guide, branding rules.
- Styles for "look and feel" aspect of site styling. Should not contain high level layout.
- Widget pallette, as a demo. Widgets that are both complex and generic can be factored out into reusable React components by dev.
